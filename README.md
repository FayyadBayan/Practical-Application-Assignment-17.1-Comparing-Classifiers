# Practical-Application-Assignment-17.1-Comparing-Classifiers
In this third practical application assignment, your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) you encountered in this section of the program. You will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

### Summary of the workbook:

1. **Initial Data Processing and Analysis**:
- We uploaded and interpreted a data file and analyzed the variables, then performed data cleaning and preparation.

2. **Classification Models**:
- Several classification models were trained such as logistic regression, decision tree, support vector, and nearest neighbors.
- We optimized the performance of these models using Grid Search to obtain the best criteria.

3. **Performance Comparison**:
- The accuracy of the models was compared before and after optimizing the criteria using Grid Search.
- We displayed the results via graphs showing the accuracy of the models on the training and test data.

4. **Recommendations and Notes**:
- We provided recommendations to improve the presentation of the results to non-technical stakeholders such as simplifying the language, using illustrative graphs, and clarifying the next steps.

5. **Applied Recommendations**:
- It was suggested to use the model in targeted marketing campaigns and increase targeting efficiency, with attention to updating the model regularly.
